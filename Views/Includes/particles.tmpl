<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>
Particle systems are groups of particles within a 3D space which are controlled by the same movement algorithms.
Systems define the source of the particles, the way they move, their color and size, and various other characteristics
of the particles.
</p>

<h3>Generation</h3>
<p>
For this project, I used the particle system logic built into the Unity Game Engine. I utilized multiple system to
create different layers within the images. For example, in the above image, there are two systems. One for the fire
and one for the water. Within each system, particle colors are adjusted slightly from the previous
previously generated particle's color, resulting in a variety of color which are close to each other but not
so close that they blend together. Each of the systems uses perlin noise to apply force to the particles in a semi-random
way. This gives a wavy effect to the result. Each of the systems generate thousands of particles per second, with each
particles fading away after a few seconds.
</p>

<h3>Post Processing</h3>
<p>
The particle trails produced by Unity are a bit rough. To address this, I tested out adding RGB noise and blurring
the result. Adding noise produced a crayon-esque texture, whereas blurring created a watercolor effect.
